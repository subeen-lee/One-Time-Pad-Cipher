I took CSC 111 three semesters ago so I noticed that while going through this assignment I will have to brush up on my programming knowledge for this course. Because I have not reviewed my previous programming materials, this assignment was a bit challenging for me. I think the hardest concept to get my head around was the shifts between the coded message, pad, and the message. 

Another trouble that I experienced was understanding why, in the ShiftLetter function, pad has to be subtracted and not added. Initially, when the equation for the code was code = (code+pad-39)%26+65, the results to the deciphered text was not readable. Now I see that adding pad returns another coded message shifting in the opposite direction of the desired message. With code = (code-pad-39)%26+65, the results returned a readable message. Learning from this big, the diagram provided on the homework page made more sense to me. 

Other troubleshoot was around me not fully understanding syntax of python. Some basic things I need to review is the format of defining functions with parameters, attributes, and for-loops. I believe I was able to complete this assignment through the help of Asmita and Grace.
