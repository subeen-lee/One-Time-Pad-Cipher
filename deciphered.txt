"[T]he world would be a better place if more engineers,
like me, hated technology. The stuff I design, if I'm
successful, nobody will ever notice. Things will just
work, and be self-managing."

-- Radia Pearlman, "the Mother of the Internet," IEEE fellow,
inventor of Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP), TRILL, and TORTIS,
a programming language for children. [https://bit.ly/2GfUkgO]
